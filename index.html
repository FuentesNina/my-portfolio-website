        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I’m originally from Martinique, a beautiful French island in the Caribbean (yes, I have a passport for France). However, and perhaps because I watched too many American movies, I decided that the US was the place to be. I moved right after high school in 2009, lived in Massachusetts, Michigan, and Indiana. After many years of holding one visa after another, I finally became a US citizen in 2022. I currently reside in sunny Florida with my husband and our fur-babies.

You might ask “why did you go to Michigan…? Isn’t cold there?” Yes, it’s cold, but that’s where my university was. I graduated from Andrews University with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. And I was offered and accepted a role at a Fortune 500 company before graduation.

After spending a few years there, I realized that this wasn’t the path for me: I wasn’t passionate about the work.

So I decided to do a 180deg turn, throw my bachelor degree in the trash, and open a health and fitness company. I helped women to transform their lifestyle through plant-based nutrition.
            
            A little bit about me. So that you know about who I am, why I do what I do and why you should hire me.

            There are going to be multipe paragraphs here. Because I am more than a couple of words

            So please, take your time and do as I say. But I don't know... maybe I want to keep it cool?</p>
