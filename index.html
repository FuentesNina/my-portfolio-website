        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm glad you're here.
            <br>
            I'm originally from Martinique, a French island in the Caribbean, and currently live in (mostly) sunny Florida.
            <br>
            I should be writing about how I've been passionate with coding since I was in high school... and while it is true that I was the go to IT support in my family‚Ä¶ I must admit that I was always intimidated by actually writing code (maybe due to the fact that most coding languages are written in English and I only spoke French at the time).
            <br>
            In college, I hesitated between getting a mechanical engineering degree and a computer science degree‚Ä¶ I picked mechanical engineering because it seemed to be offering more options at the time (and I was 18, unsure of who I was, and wanted to keep my options options).
            <br>
            Well‚Ä¶ fast-forward a decade later, a few career shifts, and here I am today. Maybe I should have gone with what my heart said all these years ago.
            <br>
            A common thread I've observed in the past years is that no matter what my role was, I'd always find myself tinkering with setting up routines to optimize processes.
            <br>
            I think I might like computers more than people: they do exactly as they're told‚Ä¶ for better or worse, haha
            <br>
            As of now, I have challenged myself to get my first role as a full-time software engineer in under 3 months.
            <br>
            I am independently going through the App Academy curriculum while freelancing and working on projects to polish my skills.
            <br>
            For example, this website was fully built using only HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript within a month of deciding to switch careers.
            <br>
            Did I mention that I'm a fast learner? üòé
            <br>
            You can find my current and past projects under the Portfolio section of this website.
            <br>
            That's all for now, maybe you have more questions for me‚Ä¶?
            <br>
            If that's the case, you can download my resume, schedule a 15-min chat with me, or send me an email.
            <br>
            I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
            <br>
            - Nina</p>
